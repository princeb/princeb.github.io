			<div class="content-post-content"><p>This is a static site generated from a little script i put together with jinja, yaml and markdown. i think it's pretty cool.
i don't actually do web stuff. i run a handful of apps off flask-restplus at work, but i don't know how it works.</p>
<p>it took me some hours spread over many weeks to think about how this SSG should work and what i needed and then to put the whole thing together.
i think imagining what you need and finding the right tools for them is probably the most time consuming part.
then you have to see if the tool actually works.</p>
<p>yaml on its own kind of sucks because it blows up if you try to put markdown in there. 
so i did some kind of yaml front matter thing but without front matter because why do you need a new library just to treats yaml tags specially?</p>
<p>as and when i have stuff to share with the world i will put them here.</p></div
